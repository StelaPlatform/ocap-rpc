    Returns an array of all logs matching a given filter object.\n\n
    Filter options:\n\n
      fromBlock: QUANTITY|TAG - (optional, default: 'latest') Integer block number, or 'latest' for the last mined block or 'pending', 'earliest' for not yet mined transactions.\n\n
      toBlock: QUANTITY|TAG - (optional, default: 'latest') Integer block number, or 'latest' for the last mined block or 'pending', 'earliest' for not yet mined transactions.\n\n
      address: DATA|Array, 20 Bytes - (optional) Contract address or a list of addresses from which logs should originate.\n\n
      topics: Array of DATA, - (optional) Array of 32 Bytes DATA topics. Topics are order-dependent. Each topic can also be an array of DATA with 'or' options.\n\n
      blockhash: DATA, 32 Bytes - (optional, future) With the addition of EIP-234, blockHash will be a new filter option which restricts the logs returned to the single block with the 32-byte hash blockHash. Using blockHash is equivalent to fromBlock = toBlock = the block number with hash blockHash. If blockHash is present in the filter criteria, then neither fromBlock nor toBlock are allowed.\n\n
